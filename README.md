# songs_data-visualization
Creating visualizations from the metadata of songs gathered with the help of mutagen library from my personal collection

I have used Mutagen python library to get the data and then with the help of Matplotlib created some visualizations.
this project is still underway and after seeing the library some might think for such small dataset excel would have been the better choice.. but ive been using excel for quite a while now and wanted to try new things thats why i have got to this approach.
