# songs_data-visualization
Creating visualizations from the metadata of songs gathered with the help of mutagen library from my personal collection

I have used Mutagen python library to get the data and then with the help of Matplotlib created some visualizations.
this project is still underway and im continuously gaining new skills in data analysis and visualization for the past 6 months and trying to improve the code here.
